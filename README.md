# Online-Book-Store

### Overview
There are many online book stores like Powellâ€™s, Amazon which were designed using Html. I
wanted to develop a similar website using SQL Server. Online Book store is an online web
application where the customer can purchase books online. Through a web browser the
customers can search for a book by its title or author, later can add to the shopping cart and
finally purchase using credit card transaction. The user can login using his account details or
new customers can set up an account very quickly. They should give the details of their name,
contact number and shipping address. The user can also give feedback to a book by giving
ratings on a score of five. The books are divided into many categories based on subject Like
Software, Database, English, Architecture, Fiction, Programming etc.
This is an simple online web store was made by using php, mysql and bootstrap.

### DATABASE
the sql for database is put in folder sql.
the database contains many tables.

To change the localhost, username, password for connecting to database, change it only one time in
www_project/functions/database_functions.php -> db_connect(). Simple and fast
The base is localhost, root, , www_project

### UPDATE
the name and pass for log-in is admin, admin. Just to make it simple.

the 2 main things are not fully implemented is contact and process purchase.
Due to having to work with some security and online payment, the process site is just a place holder.
